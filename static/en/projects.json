    "content": "\n\n\n[LHC@home](http://cern.ch/lhc) is a platform for volunteers to help physicists develop and exploit particle accelerators like [CERN’s Large Hadron Collider](http://cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html), and to compare theory with experiment in the search for new fundamental particles.\n\nBy contributing spare processing capacity on their home and laptop computers, volunteers may run simulations of beam dynamics and particle collisions in the LHC’s giant detectors.\n\nThe platform has two active projects:\n * **Sixtrack**: studies the LHC machine and its upgrade to understand the fundamental laws of the universe.\n * **Test4Theory**: researches about the elusive Higgs particle with a virtual atom smasher.\n\nThe Test4Theory project is innovative because it has been the first BOINC project using the virtualization technology to run CERN simulations in commodity computers. The project uses the open source VirtualBox hypervisor to run an instance of the [CernVM virtual appliance](http://cernvm.cern.ch/) that connects to the CERN servers to download the required libraries and dependencies in order to run the simulations.\n\nThe project has been featured in popular [news sites](http://lhcathome2.cern.ch/media) like:\n * [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14488797), \n * [Discovery Channel](http://news.discovery.com/space/hunting-the-higgs-boson-from-home-110811.html), \n * [ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/emerging-tech/2011/08/09/cern-taps-home-pcs-for-virtual-atom-smashing-40093652/), \n * [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/08/virtual-particles-cern-updates-lhchome.ars), \n * [etc](http://lhcathome2.cern.ch/media).\n\n## Web tools for the project\n\nThis project has been extended with several web tools that will help the volunteers to get more feedback from the project.\n\n### Top users and Billionaires club\n\nThe project provides an alternative *credit* system for the volunteers based on the simulations carried out within the volunteer's computers. This metric has been used to create a list with the [top 20 users](http://www.citizencyberscience.net/t4t-webapp/stats/) of the project, listing who is contributing more of their time to the project.\n\nBased on this ranking system, a [Billionaires Club](http://www.citizencyberscience.net/t4t-webapp/stats/club.html) was created as a time line adding the users that have simulated more than 1 Billion events thanks to their contributions.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"\nhref=\"https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/t4t-stats\">Source\nCode</a>.\n\n### Mozilla Firefox Add-on\n\nIn order to help the volunteers to monitor their contributions, a [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/test4theory-stats-checker) has been created. This add-on allows the users to get their latest contributions to the project via the MCPLOTs API.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"\nhref=\"https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/t4t-firefox-addon\">Source\nCode</a>.\n\n### Mozilla Firefox Marketplace Application\n\nThis app stills in the review mode but can be fully tested in the [Android Firefox Nightly version](http://nightly.mozilla.org/). The web application allows the users to monitor from their Android tablet or smartphone their contributions to the project. This application uses also the MCPLOTs API and it works also in the desktop version (even in Chrome).\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daniellombrana.es/t4t-app/\">Demo\napplication</a>.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/teleyinex/t4t-app/\"> Source Code</a>.\n\n### Test4Theory simulations Web Graphical User Interface\n\nThe project runs all the simulations within the Virtual Machine, so showing the progress to the users using the standard BOINC screensaver, it is not possible unless a server is run in the Virtual Machine. For this purpose, a web server was installed in the Virtual Machine and a simple web application is served and shows the progress and simulations carried out by Virtual Machine in any modern web browser. \n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.citizencyberscience.net/t4t-webapp/\">Demo\napplication</a>.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"\nhref=\"https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/t4t-webapp\"> Source\nCode</a>.\n",

    "content": "\n\nThis [PYBOSSA](http://daniellombrana.es/pybossa.html) application was created to integrate it with the amazing plugin [Annotorious](http://annotorious.github.io/).\n\nBasically, lots of people in [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) are using the [Image pattern recognition template](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/flickrperson/) for\nfinding patterns in a collection of pictures (i.e. [Feynman's Flowers](http://daniellombrana.es/feynmanflowers.html)).\n\nWhen talking to the developers and users needs, a lot of them always said: 'it would be cool if we can tag the pictures too, when you find something interesting'. Thus, I \ndecided to look for a solution that would help me to create another template to use in [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) but with a tagging picture feature in it.\n\nThen, at the [OKCon 2013](http://okcon.org/) I discovered the amazing JavaScript library: [Annotorious](http://annotorious.github.io/) and since then, I wanted to integrate it\nwith Crowdcrafting and [PYBOSSA](http://daniellombrana.es/pybossa.html).\n\nThe result: a very simple to use PYBOSSA template that allows you to tag any features of a collection of pictures. \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/RFfU4uT.png){: .img-responsive}\n\nThis template is really useful for scenarios where you have a lot of old photos, and you want to extract some information from them, like for example the names of the persons\nin the picture. In order to showcase this specific example, I've created a template that uses the [Australian War Memorial Collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-memorial/with/8661409625/) from Flickr to show how you can tag the name of the persons in the pictures.\n\nThe Annotorious plugin allows you to click and drag over the picture to draw a square, in order to mark the area that you want to tag, and write the information. In this example,\nthe name and surname of the person. When the user saves the current annotations as an answer, Crowdcrafting will distribute the same picture to 30 different people to get some knowledge\nand validate properly the names of the persons. In other words, thanks to this template you can do crowd driven picture tagging of pictures in a very simple way.\n",

The estimation involves the data acquisition and also the measurement of the area covered by the lichen. The data acquisition is carried out with the EpiCollect framework while the data analysis is done in the PYBOSSA application where the user will categorize the type of lichen and measure the size covered by it.\n\n<p>Lichens are composite organisms consisting of a fungus (the mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont or phycobiont) growing together in a symbiotic relationship. The photobiont is usually either a green alga (commonly Trebouxia) or cyanobacterium (commonly Nostoc). The morphology, physiology and biochemistry of lichens are very different from those of the isolated fungus and alga in culture. Lichens occur in some of the most extreme environments on Earth—arctic tundra, hot deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. However, they are also abundant as epiphytes on leaves and branches in rain forests and temperate woodland, on bare rock, including walls and gravestones, and on exposed soil surfaces (e.g., Collema) in otherwise mesic habitats. The roofs of many buildings have lichens growing on them. Lichens are widespread and may be long-lived; however, many are also vulnerable to environmental disturbance, and may be useful to scientists in assessing the effects of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v289/n5795/abs/289289a0.html\">air pollution</a>, ozone depletion, and metal contamination.</p>\n\n<p>Lichens are informally classified by growth form into:</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/47/134314157_b17f465dfc.jpg\">\n        <h3>Crusty</h3>\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/benetd/134314157/\"><i class=\"fa fa-picture-o\"></i> by benet2006</a></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2607/3986134065_faebf320c6.jpg\">\n            <h3>Leaflike</h3>\n            <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/zquirell/3986134065/\"><i class=\"fa fa-picture-o\"></i> by Boriss Lariushin</a></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3294/2451758194_ea0bbfdcc9.jpg\">\n            <h3>Shrubby</h3>\n            <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7147684@N03/2451758194/\"><i class=\"fa fa-picture-o\"></i> by Jason Hollinger</a></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Lichens as pollution indicators</h2>\n<p>Lichens are sensitive to air pollution, specially the air's acidity.

    "content": "\n\nThis [demo](http://cernsummerwebfest.github.io/LHC-HTML5-Dashboard/) is a prototype created during the [CERN Summer Webfest](http://www.citizencyberscience.net/events/cernsswebfest2011/) an event that took place at CERN in 2012.\n\nThe objective of the event was to work in teams and design neat web applications that would encourage \npeople to learn more about science, and in particular about [CERN](http://cern.ch), the LHC and particle physics.\n\nThe event was hosted during two days of really active [CERN summer students](http://hr-recruit.web.cern.ch/hr-recruit/summies/default%20page/) that worked in really amazing projects.\n\nThe following video shows a meta_description of all the projects explained by the students.\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cky9OFcoIsI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\nIn the event I participated as a coordinator and organizer, and as I love to develop new applications, I created one with the collaboration of the amazing artist and designer Andre Pierre Olivier. He helped me to improve the design and aesthetics of the application.\n\nThe [demo](http://cernsummerwebfest.github.io/LHC-HTML5-Dashboard/) shows how it will be possible to create a modern dashboard for the LHC experiments. The [current CERN dashboard](http://lhcdashboard.web.cern.ch/lhcdashboard/) renders a static PNG image that it is updated by a back-end server. The proposal of the [demo](http://cernsummerwebfest.github.io/LHC-HTML5-Dashboard/) is to use HTML5 and JavaScript to render in real time the data that the LHC experiment is showing in the dashboard.\n\n<div class=\"row-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/project/lhcdashboard.png\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/project/dashboard.png\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe [demo](http://cernsummerwebfest.github.io/LHC-HTML5-Dashboard/) uses a predifined dataset, we only had access to the [ATLAS](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/Collaboration/) luminosity data, so we added some noise to the same data in order to create a similar chart for the other experiment: [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/). The web application shows the luminosity values of the experiments in an interactive bar chart that can change between two different views in order to compare the data: group and stack.\n\nFinally, as one of the goals of the CERN Summer Webfest was to promote science, I asked the collaboration of a student, [Francesca Day](http://cambridge.academia.edu/FrancescaDay), to help me to explain in a short video what is luminosity and why is important. \n\nAs the application uses the HTML5 technology, the video is played automatically by the web browser without using any third party plugins like Adobe Flash. The web application uses the popular [Mozilla Popcorn.JS](http://popcornjs.org/) library to play and pause the video.\n",

On hitting the wall the antihydrogen annihilates with a matter nucleus in the wall to produce a burst of mostly pions and some heavier particles. These particles travel through a special gel called an emulsion which makes their tracks visible. Pions leave thin tracks while heavier particles leave much fatter tracks.\n\n<video width=\"400\" controls>\n  <source src=\"/vid/antimatter.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n</video>\n\nTracing these tracks to their point of origin tells the AEgIS team exactly where the annihilation occurred, which in turn allows them to calculate how far each particle travels. They can then work out - from the distance each particle flew and fell - how antimatter interacts with gravity.\n\nThe PYBOSSA application deployed in [Crowdcrafting.org](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/antimatter) loads a set of pictures of the gel (each area has 40 layers, being the zero layer the top one, and 39 the deepest one), playing them like a movie. The goal: allow the volunteers to draw the tracks of the particles:\n\n<video width=\"100%\" controls>\n  <source src=\"/vid/antimatter-interface.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n</video>\n\n\nThe information contributed by the users is then showed in the info page of the application as a 3D model using the WebGL technology (note if you cannot see the 3D model, then your browsers or computer does not support WebGL):\n\nDue to the success of the project, CERN twitted about the project:\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"es\"><p>Help the AEGIS experiment at CERN to figure out how antimatter is affected by gravity.

    "content": "\n\nThe way we produce goods and provide services as a society is changing. We are\nnot just consumers anymore – we create videos, music, art, software, hardware\nand much more, because the digital era has empowered us to do so. It’s easier\nthan ever before to be a producer. \n\n**So why don't we apply this model to how we do science too?**\n\n[Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) was born at a hackathon in Cape Town, South Africa in 2011.  It\nis a free and open source alternative to existing citizen science platforms. In\npartnership with our key collaborators, such as CERN, United Nations (UNITAR)\nand the University of Geneva, we have reached out to and inspired many people\nto get involved with science. And this is how we have achieved our goal of\ntransforming citizens from scientific consumers to scientific producers. \n\n\n## What is Crowdcrafting?\nCrowdcrafting is a web-based service that invites volunteers to contribute to\nscientific projects developed by citizens, professionals or institutions that\nneed help to solve problems, analyze data or complete challenging tasks that\ncan’t be done by machines alone, but require human intelligence. The platform\nis 100% open source – that is its software is developed and distributed freely\n– and 100% open-science, making scientific research accessible to everyone. \n\nCrowdcrafting uses PYBOSSA software: Our open source framework for\ncrowdsourcing projects. Institutions, such as the British Museum, CERN and\nUnited Nations (UNITAR), are also PYBOSSA users.\n\n\n## What is citizen science?\nCitizen science is the active contribution of people who are not professional\nscientists to science. It provides volunteers with the opportunity to\ncontribute intellectually to the research of others, to share resources or\ntools at their disposal, or even to start their own research projects.\nVolunteers provide real value to ongoing research while they themselves acquire\na better understanding of the scientific method. \n\nCitizen science opens the doors of laboratories and makes science accessible to\nall. It facilitates a direct conversation between scientists and enthusiasts\nwho wish to contribute to scientific endeavour.\n\n\n## How can you collaborate?\nAnyone can create a new project or contribute to an existing project in\nCrowdcrafting. All projects start with a simple tutorial explaining how they\nwork and providing all the information required to participate. There is thus\nno specific knowledge or experience required to complete proposed tasks. All\nvolunteers need is a keen attitude to learn and share science with everyone. \n\n## Talk with the team\nYou can talk directly with the team and other members of Crowdcrafting in our\n[public chat room](http://slackin.crowdcrafting.org). \n",

However, the UI was not really nice, specially on phones, so I decided to do\nsomething about it: a simple dashboard using Vuejs + Bulma + Jekyll that will be fully responsive. Moreover,\nit will allow you to save locally those posts that you like, without creating an account. How amazing is that?\n",

    "content": "\n\nThe history of circus lays usually in personal archives of citizens that loved the circus. The issue is that there's no real collection of all photos of\nthe history of circus as well as a well documentation about it. \n\nFor this reason Factoría Cultural hired me (via my company) to build a crowdsourcing platform where we will be classifying photos from the last event of\nteatro Circo Price in Madrid, Spain.\n\nThe platform was designed and built to allow to add as many collections as possible, without having to worry about where are the sources of the pictures that\nvolunteers from all over the world will classify.\n\n\n## Technologies\n\nWe used PYBOSSA for the crowdsourcing part, as well as a Nuxtjs for building the frontend. This allowed us to build a progressive web application that can be\ninstalled in the phones and people can participate as if it is a native app.\n\n\n## How it works\n\nPYBOSSA sends a picture to the volunteer, and the volunteer can answer as many questions as he/she knows:\n\n* What discipline is this?\n* How many artists are in this photo?\n* Which gender?\n* How old?\n* Which objects do you see?\n* Do you know the names and surnames of the artists?\n* Their nationality?\n\nThis project uses PYBOSSA in a very unique way, as for each of the questions we have a different task that belongs to a different project. However, thanks to the\nPYBOSSA api we can group the tasks by a unique identifier, so we can present actually 5 or more tasks to the same user for the same picture in a single page.\n\n## Data analysis\n\nThis project uses also the data analysis feature of PYBOSSA. I designed a simple statistical test, where we check (depending on the question) how many users agree on\nthe same topic. Then, based on that we increase the number of volunteers that have to participate again, and we set the canonical answer for it.\n",

    "content": "\n\nGreenpeace Spain hired me via my company Scifabric to look about the awareness ofsolar energy. Greenpeace Spain wanted to demand to the Spanish goverment that it promotes and uses green energies among its citizens.\n\nFor achieving this goal, I designed a crowdsourcing project where we mapped the public buildings of Spain (via the transparent data portal), and we ask volunteers from all over the world to confirm the location of the buildings as well as measuring the square meters of the roofs.\n\nFor building the platform we used: PYBOSSA and NuxtJS. I build a Progressive Web Application that can be used from phones, tablets and desktops.\n\nThe project uses the real-time data analysis features of PYBOSSA, and the next sections explain the methodology that I developed for the client.\n\n## Data capture: Public buildings from Spain´s Public Administration. \n\nTo create this project we needed a database with all the public buildings belonging to the Central Public Administration.\n\nThe Spanish National Treasury has a [web portal](http://transparencia.gob.es/servicios-buscador/buscar.htm?categoria=bienesinmuebles_ind&categoriasPadre=conconvsub&ente=I00000179,EA0008567,E04585801,E00003901,E00003301,E04921301,E04990101,E00003801,E00003601,E04921401,E04921501,E04921601,E04990201,E04921701,E04990301,E00004101,E04990401,E04921801,E04990501,E04921901&lang=es&tipocibi=edificio) which we have used to obtain the list of public buildings used to build this project.\n\nThe data provided by the Spanish Government for each building is:\n\n* Type: they are all buildings\n* Location: their postal address\n* Use: to what ministry or government department the building belongs to\n* Surface: square meters of the building´s surface\n\nThe relevant data to us is the location, we want to measure the building's rooftop area.\n\n### Building Geolocation\n\nWith the postal address of each building, we went to Google Maps and searched their coordinates (latitude and longitude) to place every building on a map.\n\nOf the 9959 buildings displayed in the transparency portal, Google only has results for 5253 of these. This is mainly due to the fact that the provided addresses are badly formatted or simply wrong. This is why in only 5253 public buildings can be analysed in this first phase.\n\n### Measuring rooftop areas and their solar panels\n\nWith the geolocated buildings, we then move on to the web project. For this project, we are using [PYBOSSA](https://scifabric.com/howitworks/), a technology that allows for each building to be analysed by several people at one time to then later statistically analyse all of the participants´ contributions to generate valid results for every building.\n\nThe steps to follow in this project are:\n\n* A participant is asked to find a building for the address that we have.\n* Once located, the area -rooftop outline, is drawn.\n* The participant is then asked if there are solar panels if so he/she is requested to mark its outline, otherwise the analysis is complete.\n\nBy default each building is studied by 3 people. When the third person submits his/her analysis, the system statistically analyses the contributions and provides a result.\n\n\n# Statistics analysis\n\nIn order to avoid participants who wish to send wrongful data, the system validates the data as follows:\n\n* For each polygon -rooftop or solar panel area, it calculates the geometric center (centroid).\n* With all centroids, it searches those groups that are within a circle in which the distance -or maximum error, is 20 meters.\n* If the participants have correctly drawn the roof and/or solar panels, their centroids will be very close together and they will meet the previous step.\n* Those that are within the cluster, will move on to the next phase: polygon area calculation, with those that are not inside being eliminated.\n* For the area the standard deviation is calculated: the different quartiles (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) as well as the maximum and minimum value sent by the participants.\n* If the users answered that there are solar panels, then steps 1 to 5 -described here, are to be repeated for each solar panel.\n\nThis way we can eliminate those contributions that are not good  allowing us to focus on the data that we need\n\n## Power, investment, CO2, etc. calculation\n\nOnce that the extension for each of the Central Government´s rooftops has been measured, the potential of photovoltaic electricity that could be generated in each one of those rooftops is calculated, as well as the CO2 emissions that could be avoided alongside with the financial savings that would mean for the Central Government and, therefore, for the citizens.\n\n### Photovoltaic potential\n\n* The roof extension is multiplied by 0.5 to take into account possible shadows and/or other elements that would avoid the installation of solar energy.\n* It is considered that the other rooftop half is covered with photovoltaic panels and each square meter with 167 watts of power. The power that could be installed on the roof is multiplied by the average real annual photovoltaic production of the province in which the building is located according to the data provided by [Red Eléctrica de España](https://www.esios.ree.is/is/maps-of-interest/map-of-production-annual-media-photovoltaic). With this, we obtain the annual electricity production that could be generated if half of the measured roof was covered with solar panels.\n\n### Public Coffers savings\n\nWe believe that the electricity that could be produced in the measured roof could be instantly used up in the same building and therefore saving money generated by the installation, which would be the difference between the electricity that the Central Government no longer has to buy to the electric company (€ 0.139 + VAT 21% and 5.11269% electricity tax) and the investment required to carry out the photovoltaic installation (€ 1.45 / W) - a lifetime of 25 years is considered per installation.\n\nIf the available roof area surface is less than 60m2 (<10kW) we consider that, what is known in Spain as, the Sun Tax (for a 3.0 A connection point) is not applicable as well as are the cases of the Canary Islands, Melilla, Ceuta, Ibiza, and Formentera.\n\nIn the other cases, the Sun Tax that should be paid for by the Administration on self-consumed electricity is instantly introduced (transitory charge for self-consumed energy for a 3.0 A connection point as established by the [Government](https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2016-12464)\n\n\n### Greenhouse Gas Emissions savings\n\nTo calculate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that each installation would avoid from occurring, the production of renewable electricity is multiplied by the emission factor of the electrical system of the Spanish region in which the building is located according to the data provided by Red Eléctrica Española for the year [2017](http://www.ree.es/es/estadisticas-del-sistema-electrico-espanol/series-estadisticas/series-estadisticas-nacionales)\n\nMainland Spain: 0.269 kg CO2 / kWh\nBalearic Islands: 0,714 kg CO2 / kWh\nCeuta and Melilla: 0,745 kg CO2 / kWh\nCanary Islands: 0,775 kg CO2/kWh\n\n\n### Equivalences\n\nTo calculate the necessary equivalences to make the data provided more understandable, the following information has been considered:\n\n* Annual electricity consumption of an average Spanish household: 3,500 kWh / year\n* Emissions of an average gasoline car from the current vehicle fleet 160 gCO2 / km\n* Lawn surface of the Santiago Bernabéu football field: 105m * 68m\n\n## Software used\nFor the analysis, the statistical package [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is used, as well as the algorithm [DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) to generate the clusters.\n\nThe rest is [PYBOSSA](https://scifabric.com) and [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).\n\n",

By using P2P networks to store and save data, the platform shared only small chunks of the data with different partners, making impossible to download your collection unless the owner shared with you a special token to build the data back.\n\n## Key features of the project\n\nData was stored within the network, not on third party services like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure storing solutions. This ensured that your data was only shared with institutions and colleagues that joined the network.\n\nThe network was created and mantained by galleries, collectors, curators, and institutions. From artists to artists.\n\nSharing was as simple as sending via email a token that the receiver will open in the platform, giving it access to the data.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe Spanish Ministry of Culture and Sports recognized the project Digital Art Drive as one of the [best of 2018](https://www.culturaydeporte.gob.es/cultura/industriasculturales/mejores-proyectos/mejores-proyectos-2018/modernizacion/conservacion-arte-digital.html).\n\n## Software used\nFor the data storage and sharing [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) was used. For the backend [Python](https://www.python.org/), and for the frontend [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).\n",
