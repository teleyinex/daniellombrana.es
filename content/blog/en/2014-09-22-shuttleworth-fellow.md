One year ago I started a [fellowship](http://shuttleworthfoundation.org) that
changed my life.

One year later, the [Shuttleworth
Foundation](http://shuttleworthfoundation.org) has renewed my fellowship for
another year. Amazing!

## Becoming a fellow

One of the most interesting aspects of pitching to Shuttleworth Foundation is
the [video pitch](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/applications/). Last year,
I wrote a [blog post about it](/blog/2013/09/23/video-tutorial.html) explaining
how I shot that video.

*The video is a very interesting exercise*, as you are forced to express your
ideas in a very succinct way, as you only have 5 minutes, and you have to use
them wisely.

My first video was done in two days, and I loved the result, however I needed
something better for my second year.

I wanted to show *how much I love my work*,
who am I, and what do I do thanks to the foundation's support. The result?
Well, judge it yourself (please leave me a comment about the video):

*I'll write another blog post about the video and its creation. I promise.*

The foundation liked it, and I have another year to do many more things thanks
to their support.

## Year in review

The first fellowship year helped me to have a [team](http://pybossa.com/about/)
of awesome people. Thanks to the their support, I've managed to
hire a UX person (to me he's the best in the world), two developers (that work
really hard and love what they do), and a young communications person (who writes
awesome blog posts about our work) -don't be shy and check our [team
page](http://pybossa.com/about/).

Now, with a team behind [PYBOSSA](http://pybossa.com) and
[Crowdcrafting](http://Crowdcrafting.org), I could move quickly, learn from the
team, attend more meatings, develope new features and make Crowdcrafting a place
to hang out for citizen scientists.

## Growing step by step

While we were working, we got a great opportunity: the [British
Museum](http://www.britishmuseum.org/) and the [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)
were interested in [PYBOSSA](http://pybossa.com) and more importantly: *they
wanted to use it for their [own citizen science project](http://micropasts.org/).*

In April of 2014, the project was launched with great [coverage](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0414/160414-crowdsourcing-bronze-age)
from the
[press](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/18/volunteers-british-museum-crowdsourcing-archeology).
At the time of this writing, the project has managed to have more than 1
thousand contributors with 18 published projects. Awesome!

We worked with them closely to build two templates that have being used to build
the 18 projects:

 * a transcription template to make available a huge card catalogue of British
     prehistoric metal artefacts discovered in the 19th and 20th century, and
 * a template that enables the creation of a high quality 3D model of an
     archaeological artefact via process known as photo-masking.

I'm really proud of the work done for this project and its successthe work done
for this. This achievement has proved that PYBOSSA is mature to be used as a
tool for doing citizen science, and more importantly that international
institutions trust our software, tools and methodologies.

## Exciting times ahead

I collaborate with the [Medialab-Prado](http://medialab-prado.es) institution
in Madrid, Spain, and I coordinate there the citizen science workstation. As
part of my collaboration, we organize international workshops where anyone can
pitch their project. If the project is interesting, it gets accepted, and a
group of collaborators join you to collaborate.

In one of these
[calls](http://medialab-prado.es/article/madridlaboratoriourbano), a research
group from the [Complutense University](http://guaix.fis.ucm.es/node/1651)
applied to create a citizen science project to analyze the light pollution of
cities. The interesting part: they wanted to use photographs taken directly
from the International Space Station by astronauts!

Cool, right? And best of all: *they wanted to use Crowdcrafting for developing
the project!!!*

![Oh My God GIF](http://i.giphy.com/QMcamps7Gzj2g.gif){: .img-responsive}

The project was accepted and left beta in July. In this month the research
group sent out a [press release about the
project](https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/media/www/pag-56948/Atlas%20de%20im%C3%A1genes%20nocturnas%20DEFbuena.pdf).
The press release was sent to [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/) and
[ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA) and they supported the project with
tweets like this one from ESA:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es" align="center"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Citizenscience?src=hash">#Citizenscience</a> at work RT <a href="https://twitter.com/teleyinex">@teleyinex</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/esa">@esa</a> thanks to your help on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/cities4tnight">@cities4tnight</a> has 3000 tasks classified in <a href="https://twitter.com/crowdcrafting">@crowdcrafting</a></p>&mdash; ESA (@esa) <a href="https://twitter.com/esa/status/487228335018475521">julio 10, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


Then, the unexpected happened. NASA wrote a [full
article](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/crowdsourcing_night_images/#.U-zmA_ldWSo)
about the project and obviously tweeted it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es" align="center"><p>Space station sharper images of Earth at night crowdsourced for science: <a href="http://t.co/bHBiLwvZSv">http://t.co/bHBiLwvZSv</a>   <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISS?src=hash">#ISS</a> <a href="http://t.co/bL9LymQ6cq">pic.twitter.com/bL9LymQ6cq</a></p>&mdash; NASA (@NASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/499963958552711168">agosto 14, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


The result? Well lots of international media mentioned the project like
[Popsci](http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/do-try-home/join-crowd),
[Co.Exists](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3033228/these-incredible-photos-from-astronauts-show-the-brightest-cities-on-earth),
[NBC
News](http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/scientists-want-you-help-crowdsource-night-lights-n181116),
[CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/17/tech/nasa-earth-images-help-needed/index.html?hpt=hp_t2),
[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/), [Smithsonian
Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/help-nasa-out-looking-beautiful-pictures-space-180952407/?no-ist),
[etc](http://pybossa.com/press/).

Amazing right? Well, this was not yet the best part. Trust me. The 21 of
August, FOX News TV showed on prime time
[Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) and how to contribute to the
project:

Thanks to this *amazing coverage* **Crowdcrafting stored in one single day more than one
answer per second**, with thousands of new volunteers registering in the site
and thousands of tasks completed in hours! (check the
[statistics](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/darkskies/stats)).

![Despicable Me Minion OMG](http://i.giphy.com/CHyxN9bNkMc3S.gif){: .img-responsive}

Since then, we have had new users registering every day, tasks completed every
day, and lots of contributions from volunteers. Amazing!

And this has happened only in the first year of my fellowship, so what will
bring my second year? Really looking into it!!!!
