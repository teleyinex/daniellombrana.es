Doing a PhD is laborious, hard, demanding, exhausting... Your thesis is usually the
result of blood, sweat and tears. And you are usually alone. Well, what woud you say
if I tell you that a researcher got helped by more than 17 thousand volunteers?

<!--more-->

Yes, you've read it right: more than 17 thousand people have helped Alejandro SÃ¡nchez to do his
research, publishing his thesis as a result and getting the best possible mark: *cum laude*. Amazing, right?

But how this happened? How did he managed to involve such a big crowd? I mean, most people
think science is boring, tedious, *difficult*, add here your adjective... However, this
guy managed to get 17 thousand people from all over the world to help him on:

</div>

Best part? They did it because they wanted to help. No money involved! Just pure kindness.

In other words, *the unexpected happened*, and thanks to *sharing* his work and also *asking for help* for his research -studying light pollution on cities- he managed to achieve the
unconceivable: involving more than 17 thousand people on scientific research.

How this started? Well, let's start from the beginning.

## The beginning: laying down the ideas

This adventure started in 2014, in London, UK. I was participating at the [Citizen Cyberscience Summit](http://cybersciencesummit.org/)
and Alejandro was there because someone told him to learn more about [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org).

At the summit there was a workshop where scientists and hackers joined forces to
create new *citizen science* projects. Wait, let me explain first what's citizen
science so we can enjoy the trip later on (like this kid, I promise).

**Citizen science** is the active contribution of people who are not professional scientists to science. It provides volunteers with the opportunity to contribute intellectually to the research of others, to share resources or tools at their disposal, or even to start their own research projects. Volunteers provide real value to ongoing research while they themselves acquire a better understanding of the scientific method.

In other words, **citizen science** opens the doors of laboratories and makes science accessible to all. It facilitates a direct conversation between scientists and enthusiasts who wish to contribute to scientific endeavor.

Now, with this idea in our minds let's get back to Alejandro's research.

At this workshop Alejandro told me that he was studying light pollution on cities. He and his team realized
that the astronauts from the International Space Station take pictures of the earth with a
regular camera. Those pictures are then saved in a big archive. However, there are some issues:

 * The pictures could be from cities at night or day.
 * They take selfies too (who doesn't?)
 * The moon, stars and Aurora Borealis are also pretty, so they photograph them too.
 * The archive does not have any order or filter, everything is mixed in there.

In summary, he needs pictures at night of cities (sharp and without clouds) but the archive
is a mess. The archive has too many different photos and possible scenarios that algorithms cannot help
him to classify them (or at a later stage geolocate them). However, you and me are pretty good
at identifying cities at night with a glimpse, so we decided to create a prototype in Crowdcrafting.

The first project was [Dark Skies](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/darkskies/). We had the first
prototype in a few hours and we basically asked people to help us to classify the pictures
in different categories:

 * City at night
 * Aurora Borealis
 * Stars
 * None of these
 * Black
 * Astronaut
 * I don't know

The project was simple and fun. I remember enjoying a lot classifying beautiful
pictures from the ISS. It make me feel I was an astronaut, and I loved that feeling so
we share it with our friends and colleagues.

We really believed on the project, specially Alejandro, so he invited me to meet his PhD advisor and his
colleagues. We met and studied how we could improve it. As a result two new projects were born in the next months: [Lost at night](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/LostAtNight/) and [Night Cities ISS](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/nightcitiesiss/)

## The small announcement that became huge

After a lot of work, Alejandro thought that the projects were good enough to send
them to NASA and ESA. Alejandro wrote a press release and share with them what we
were doing.

In the beginning we thought that they will ignore us, but something happened. It started
like a tremble. With a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es" align="center"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Citizenscience?src=hash">#Citizenscience</a> at work RT <a href="https://twitter.com/teleyinex">@teleyinex</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/esa">@esa</a> thanks to your help on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/cities4tnight">@cities4tnight</a> has 3000 tasks classified in <a href="https://twitter.com/crowdcrafting">@crowdcrafting</a></p>&mdash; ESA (@esa) <a href="https://twitter.com/esa/status/487228335018475521">julio 10, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then, almost one month later [NASA wrote a full article about the project](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/crowdsourcing_night_images) and tweeted about it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es" align="center"><p>Space station sharper images of Earth at night crowdsourced for science: <a href="http://t.co/bHBiLwvZSv">http://t.co/bHBiLwvZSv</a>   <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISS?src=hash">#ISS</a> <a href="http://t.co/bL9LymQ6cq">pic.twitter.com/bL9LymQ6cq</a></p>&mdash; NASA (@NASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/499963958552711168">agosto 14, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

That was the spark, as since that moment everything exploded! The project was covered internationally by the press. Media like [Fox TV](http://video.foxnews.com/v/3742323090001/nasa-asks-for-help-tracking-locations-in-iss-photos/?#sp=show-clips), [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/nasa-wants-you-to-sift-through-its-astronauts-photos-1623753892), [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/17/tech/nasa-earth-images-help-needed/index.html?hpt=hp_t2), [...](http://pybossa.com/press/) share the project and invited people to help.

Thanks to this coverage, in just one month we were able to classify more than 100 thousand images. One day Crowdcrafting servers stored more than 1.5 answers per second! We were like this:

</div>

## The calm after the storm

As with any press coverage after a few weeks everything went back to normal. However,
lots of people kept coming and helping the projects from Alejandro.

Over a year we kept fixing bugs, adding new tasks, answering questions from volunteers, sharing progress,
etc. In July Alejandro defended his thesis with all this work. Amazing!

From my side I'm so happy and proud about it for two reasons. First, while the thesis
has been presented, the projects keeps going.

At the time of this writing
the Dark Skies project has classified almost 700 images in the last 15 days. Amazing!

The other two projects have less activity, as those projects are more complicated.
[Lost at Night](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/LostAtNight/) has located more than 200
photos on a map, and [Night Cities ISS](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/nightcitiesiss/) has
geo-referenced almost 25 pictures.

Secondly, because this is the very first thesis that uses PYBOSSA and Crowdcrafting
for doing open research. I'm impressed and I think this is just the beginning for many
more researchers doing their research on the open inviting society to take part on it.

The future? Well, Alejandro has launched a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1550160587/cities-at-night) campaign to get financial support
to keep running the research his doing. If he gets the financial support more data will
be analyzed, new results will be produced and it will help to keep running Crowdcrafting
and PYBOSSA. Thus, if you like the project help Alejandro to build the most beautiful
atlas of earth at night!
