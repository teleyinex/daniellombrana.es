The 29 and 30 of November of 2013 I organized with the support of [FECYT](http://fecyt.es/), [La Caixa Forum](http://obrasocial.lacaixa.es/nuestroscentros/caixaforummadrid/caixaforummadrid_es.html) and
[Medialab-Prado](http://medialab-prado.es) the second [citizen science hackfest](http://medialab-prado.es/article/encuentrodecienciaciudadana) in Madrid, Spain.

<!--more-->
The event this time had the participation of two respected experts in the field of Citizen Science:

* Francois Grey, from [Citizen Cyberscience Centre](http://citizencyberscience.net),
* Shannon Dosemagen, from [Public Labs](http://publiclab.org/), and
* Fermín Serrano, from [Ibercivis Foundation](http://ibercivis.es/)

The hackfest started with a morning session with talks from all the experts in a dedicated session
for the FECYT ComCiRed event at Medialab-Prado.

Francois Grey introduced the past,
present and future of citizen science.

Shannon explained how her team create open hardware tools
for measuring the world (balloon mapping tools, spectrometers, infrared cameras, etc.) representing
the *volunteer sensing* area.

Then, Fermín Serrano presented the Ibercivis Foundation and its work
in Spain regarding *volunteer computing* with several research projects.

I closed the session
talking about *volunteer thinking* showing how [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) can
be used by citizens or researchers to create citizen science projects in minutes.


After lunch, we meet again and presented the proposed projects to work during the 30th of November
at Medialab-Prado. The Saturday started with a short briefing for the day, explaining the [micro-workshops](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/cienciaciudadana)
that we will be having along the day:

* Balloon Mapping: mapping your surroundings,
* EpiCollect+: gathering data with your phone,
* Crowdcrafting: creating your own citizen science project in minutes, and
* DIY Spectrometer

## Balloon Mapping

We started with the balloon mapping workshop. Shannon explained step by step how to
build the balloon mapping using one of the kits they shell (but that you can build yourself if you want).

We had a very good weather in terms of wind: the balloon was really stable as well as the
camera, however it was really cold!

## EpiCollect+

Then, we had the [EpiCollect+](http://plus.epicollect.net/) workshop. We worked in creating an Odour Collect project
that basically asks volunteers to quantify or calify the odours that you can find in the
city. All you need to participate, is to install the EpiCollect+ application in your Android
phone (iOS coming soon!) and join the [project](http://plus.epicollect.net/OdourCollect/).

We also worked in adding more data samples for the [Crowdcrafting Lichens project](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/airquality/)
with the participants of the events. We went to park El Retiro, split in teams, and take
several samples with our phones. The result: [almost 50 new samples from Madrid city](http://plus.epicollect.net/lichens/Lichens) that
can be directly analyzed in the [Crowdcrafting project](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/airquality/).

## Crowdcrafting

Then we moved to the Crowdcrafting workshop, were I teached and showed how you can create a
citizen science project using the available templates, and more impotantly, how you can import
the data from the previous two workshops into a Crowdcrafting application, and analyze the data
with the help of the volunteers.

For example, after taking the pictures of the balloon mapping workshop, a group of the participants
ortho-referenced the pictures for creating the following map:

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
<iframe style="border:none;" width="500" height="375" src="http://archive.publiclab.org/leaflet/?tms=http://mapknitter.org/tms/plant-wall-in-madrid/&lat=40.4110814393&lon=-3.6931872467"></iframe>
</div>

That was imported into a [Crowdcrafting application](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/balloonmappingmadrid/), using this [template](http://github.com/PYBOSSA/app-mapknitter).
The result, people can help you to count the number of participants in the workshop really easily.

The template provides also an example for measuring areas within the map, and this was the clue to
propose to the [Medialab-Prado Urban Bees Keepers](http://mieldebarrio.wordpress.com/) to use this
technique to map the roofs of the city, and quantify which ones are good or not (sometimes they cannot
access the roofs) and also to measure how many square meters are available to place several hives.

## DIY Spectrometer

We ended the hackfest with the last workshop: build your own spectrometer. This time, we had the collaboration
of the Medialab-Prado Origami team, as this spectrometer is built using a sheet of paper. In the following
video you can see how we built several spectrometers and play with them.

As you can see, we learned a lot, we produced several prototypes along the day, and
above all: *we had a lot of fun while learning*. If you want to participate in the next
citizen science hackfest in Madrid, keep an eye in the [Medialab-Prado website](http://medialab-prado.es),
my site and/or [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/teleyinex).

PS: I would like to give a **big thank you** to FECYT, La Caixa Forum and Medialab-Prado
for supporting the event, to Francois, Shanon and Fermín for coming to Madrid and present their
work in citizen science, and also to all the participants: without you this would not be possible! THANKS!!!
