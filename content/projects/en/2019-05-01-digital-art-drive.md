This project created a safe and realliable way to store digital art collections within the crowd. By using P2P networks to store and save data, the platform shared only small chunks of the data with different partners, making impossible to download your collection unless the owner shared with you a special token to build the data back.

## Key features of the project

Data was stored within the network, not on third party services like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure storing solutions. This ensured that your data was only shared with institutions and colleagues that joined the network.

The network was created and mantained by galleries, collectors, curators, and institutions. From artists to artists.

Sharing was as simple as sending via email a token that the receiver will open in the platform, giving it access to the data.

The Spanish Ministry of Culture and Sports recognized the project Digital Art Drive as one of the [best of 2018](https://www.culturaydeporte.gob.es/cultura/industriasculturales/mejores-proyectos/mejores-proyectos-2018/modernizacion/conservacion-arte-digital.html).
