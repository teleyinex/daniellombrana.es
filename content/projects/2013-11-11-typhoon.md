This [PYBOSSA](http://daniellombrana.es/pybossa.html) application was created in response to the [Typhoon Pablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Bopha_%282012%29) in the Philippines. The goal was to help the [Digital Humanitarian Network](http://irevolution.net/2012/12/05/digital-response-to-typhoon-philippines/) to analyze the posted tweets about the typhoon in order to identify pictures and/or videos of the damage.

The application loads a tweet (from CSV dataset) and presents a simple interface where the users have to analyze if the tweet has one or more links with a pictureo and/or a video of the damage caused by the typhoon. 

If the tweet has enough information about the location of the damage, a web map is shown to the user, so he can actually mark the position of the damage based on the information from the tweet.
