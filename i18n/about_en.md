# Hey there!

My name is Daniel, and I'm a computer engineer with over 10 years of experience under my belt. I specialize in creating top-notch digital products using Python, Javascript (ES6), CSS3, VueJS, NuxtJS, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

I'm proud to say that I've worked with a range of organizations, including the British Museum, British Library, Cancer Research UK, the Guardian Australia, Greenpeace Spain, and the European Space Agency (ESA). Some of my projects have even gained more than 700 stars on Github!

I'm not just a web developer, though. I've also been exploring the world of web3 and NFTs. I'm an active member of the OBEY community, and I played a significant role in creating code for the Collections DGN/RGN project. This project allows NFT owners to create different layouts of their NFTs into a unique NFT, and I coded the backend, frontend, and the solidity smart contract.

When it comes to web development, I always strive to use the best tools and technologies to meet my clients' needs. If you have a wireframe or mockup, I'll work side-by-side with your UX/UI team to develop all your project's screens. With my experience and skills, I can guarantee that your project will be in good hands.

If you're looking for a computer engineer who is passionate about what he does and can bring your project to the next level, then look no further. Get in touch with me today, and let's make something amazing together!
