This has allowed me to develop [tools that have more than 600 stars in Github](https://github.com/teleyinex). Institutions like the British Museum, British Library, Cancer Research UK, the Guardian Australia, Greenpeace Spain or European Space Agency (ESA) are just a few examples of the companies that have trusted in my work.",
